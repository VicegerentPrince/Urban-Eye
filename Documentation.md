## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow
```javascript
// Protected Route Implementation
const ProtectedRoute = ({ children, userType }) => {
  const user = authService.getCurrentUser();
  if (!user) return <Navigate to="/login" />;
  if (userType && user.userType !== userType) {
    // Role-based redirection
    switch(user.userType) {
      case 'admin': return <Navigate to="/admin" />;
      case 'official': return <Navigate to="/official" />;
      default: return <Navigate to="/citizen" />;
    }
  }
  return children;
};
```

### Issue Reporting Implementation
```javascript
// FormData handling for issue submission
const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  const issueData = new FormData();
  issueData.append('title', formData.title);
  issueData.append('description', formData.description);
  issueData.append('latitude', formData.location[0]);
  issueData.append('longitude', formData.location[1]);
  // Handle media files
  Array.from(formData.images).forEach(image => {
    issueData.append('images', image);
  });
};
```

### Camera Integration
```javascript
// Camera capture component
function CameraCapture({ onCapture, onClose, mode }) {
  const videoRef = useRef(null);
  const mediaRecorderRef = useRef(null);
  
  // Camera setup
  useEffect(() => {
    async function setupCamera() {
      const mediaStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
        video: { facingMode: 'environment' },
        audio: mode === 'video'
      });
      videoRef.current.srcObject = mediaStream;
    }
    setupCamera();
  }, [mode]);
}
```

## UI/UX Design

### Styling Approach
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Custom color scheme:
  - Primary: Emerald (600)
  - Secondary: Yellow (400)
  - Accent: Teal (500)
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Mobile-first approach
- Animated transitions

### Animation Implementation
```javascript
// Example of Framer Motion usage
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
>
  {/* Component content */}
</motion.div>
```

## Best Practices
